# H3D-AD: A Dataset of High-Resolution 3D Anomaly Detection Tasks

This project aims to construct a new dataset of high-resolution 3D point clouds for anomaly detection tasks in real-world scenes.

**H3D-AD** can be used for training and testing 3D anonmaly detection algorithms.

Note that different from RGB + Depth patterns, we only provide **3D point clouds** for users.

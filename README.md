# Overview
This project aims to construct a new dataset of **high-resolution 3D point clouds** for anomaly detection tasks in real-world scenes.

**H3D-AD** can be used for training and testing 3D anonmaly detection algorithms.

Note that different from RGB + Depth patterns, we **only** provide 3D point clouds for users.
